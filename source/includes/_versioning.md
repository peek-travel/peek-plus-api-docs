# Versioning

Another advantage of GraphQL is that the need for versioning largely goes away; the schema evolves overtime without the need for strict versions.

### Backwards Compatible Changes

99% of our GraphQL changes are backwards compatible; they involve deprecating a field which just results in a warning if used but doesn't stop working. Or it's a new field altogether and since you aren't asking for it, it doesn't affect you.

### Breaking Changes

We do everything possible to avoid these, and at the time of writing this, see no reason why we'll ever have them. That said, let's say a field has been deprecated for 6 months and an integration continues to use it even after being told that it's going away, eventually that field will have to go, which yes, would be a breaking change. Beyond this we don't see a reason why we can't evolve this API through clean deprecations. We will notify all clients using deprecated fields of the potential breaking change and give ample time to update before removing completely.
